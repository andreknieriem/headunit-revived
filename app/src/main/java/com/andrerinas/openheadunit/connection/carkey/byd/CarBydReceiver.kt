/**
 * Panel and steering-wheel keys on a BYD head unit.
 *
 * These units deliver their media buttons as raw byte frames on an unprotected broadcast from
 * `com.byd.multimediaservice`, never as Android key events — see [BydPanelKey] for why the standard
 * path cannot see them at all. That makes this the one car-key receiver that has to decode a
 * payload rather than read a key code out of an extra, which is why it lives apart from
 * [com.andrerinas.openheadunit.connection.carkey.CarKeyBroadcastReceiver] and its table of OEM
 * actions.
 *
 * The frame carries a press with no matching release, so each one becomes a full click.
 * `CommManager` de-duplicates and decides whether the key reaches Android Auto at all, including
 * dropping every one of these while nothing is projecting — which is this app's version of the
 * gating the stock player does when another audio source owns the unit.

     * There is no reliable BYD marker to test: the units this was captured on are a Freescale board
     * running Android 4.4 with no vendor property naming the manufacturer, and probing for
     * [MULTIMEDIA_PACKAGE] would silently disable the feature on any firmware variant that renamed
     * it — a false negative here is a head unit whose media buttons do nothing, which is far worse
     * than an idle receiver on a unit that never sends the action. Registering costs one
     * `IntentFilter` with one vendor-specific action that no other head unit broadcasts.
     *
     * Note what this does *not* protect against. The channel is unprotected in both directions: any
     * installed app can `sendBroadcast` a well-formed frame, and a receiver cannot tell an injected
     * one from a real press. [BydPanelKey.panelKeyCode] bounds that to the panel key space rather
     * than preventing it, and `CommManager` will only forward while a projection is actually running
     * — but within those bounds an injected frame is indistinguishable from a button press. The same
     * is already true of every action
     * [com.andrerinas.openheadunit.connection.carkey.CarKeyBroadcastReceiver] listens on, including
     * `MEDIA_BUTTON`.
